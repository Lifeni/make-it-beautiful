## FAQ

### Why not support the Firefox browser?

Because the core function provided by this extension is included in the Firefox.

### Which languages are supported for code highlighting?

See: [components/queryFileType.ts](components/queryFileType.ts).

### Why do not save buttons appear on some pages?

Due to the influence of Content Security Policy (CSP), some websites cannot trigger the save dialog box and need to be saved manually (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> or right-click menu to save).

For websites where the save button does not appear, see: [components/queryCSPDomainList.ts](components/queryCSPDomainList.ts).

## Development

This project contains two versions of manifest v3 and v2 at the same time. The functions of the two versions are the same. During development, you can package v3 and v2 respectively according to `webpack.config.ts` and `webpack.config.v2.ts`.

Dependencies need to be installed before development. Yarn is recommended.

```shell
yarn
```

Use `npm run dev` to run the v3 version of the development and build. It is recommended to use Chrome Canary for debugging.
