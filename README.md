## Development

Dependencies need to be installed before development. Yarn is recommended.

```shell
cd make-it-beautiful
yarn
```

This project contains both manifest v3 and v2 versions, both of which have the same functionality.

You can switch between the two versions during development based on the environment variable `MANIFEST`.

```shell
webpack --progress --env MANIFEST=v3
# webpack --progress --env MANIFEST=v2
```

Use `npm run dev` to run the v3 development build, and Chrome Canary is recommended for debugging.
