## FAQ

### Why not support the Firefox browser?

Because the core function provided by this extension is included in the Firefox.

### Which languages are supported for code highlighting?

See: [src/utils/queryFileType.ts](src/utils/queryFileType.ts).

### Why does the save button not appear on some pages?

Due to the Content Security Policy (CSP), some sites do not trigger the save dialog and need to be saved manually (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> or right-click menu save).

For sites where the save button does not appear see: [src/utils/queryCSPDomain.ts](src/utils/queryCSPDomain.ts).

### Why is there no search function?

Because the search that comes with the browser (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd>) is good enough for most needs.

### Why isn't it on the Chrome Web Store?

The author can't afford to sign up for a developer account.

## Development

This project contains two versions of manifest v3 and v2 at the same time. The functions of the two versions are the same. During development, you can switch between different builds based on the 'MANIFEST' environment variable, see [package.json](./package.json).

Dependencies need to be installed before development. Yarn is recommended.

```shell
cd make-it-beautiful
yarn
```

Use `npm run dev` to run the v3 version of the development and build. It is recommended to use Chrome Canary for debugging.
